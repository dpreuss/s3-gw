# Starfish Backend TODOs

## Security & Access Control
- [x] Add authentication to starfish-fileserver (middleware to validate requests using the shared API token)
- [x] Implement bucket-level access control for starfish backend using VersityGW's ACL/policy system
- [x] Integrate starfish backend with VersityGW's IAM system (LDAP, Vault, or file-based)
- [x] Add authentication middleware to starfish-fileserver to validate requests against VersityGW auth system
- [x] Add SSL/TLS support to starfish-fileserver for secure file transfers

## Enterprise Features Integration (Phase 2)
- [x] Enable existing LDAP/Vault integration for Starfish backend (handled by VersityGW platform)
- [x] Integrate Starfish operations with VersityGW's audit logging (automatic via controller layer)
- [x] Configure rate limiting and access controls from VersityGW (automatic via middleware)
- [x] Implement VersityGW's error handling patterns for Starfish (enhanced error types and conversion)

## Performance & Operations Enhancement (Phase 3)
- [x] Integrate Starfish caching with VersityGWâ€™s IAM caching (enhanced cache with metrics integration)
- [x] Optimize Starfish backend performance using VersityGW patterns (connection pooling, HTTP/2, compression)
- [x] Add monitoring and metrics for Starfish operations (comprehensive metrics tracking)
- [x] Enhance configuration management for Starfish backend (performance tuning options)

## Documentation & Testing (Phase 4)
## Documentation
- [x] Update README.md to include Starfish as a supported backend
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for starfish backend (setup, configuration, usage examples)
- [x] Update extra/example.conf to include starfish backend configuration options and examples
- [x] Update extra/versitygw@.service to support starfish backend in VGW_BACKEND validation

## Code Quality & Testing
- [x] Optimize starfish backend performance (caching, connection pooling, query batching)
- [x] Improve error handling and logging in starfish backend
- [ ] Expand test coverage for starfish backend (integration tests, error scenarios)
